====================

		This is a Web Forms example of how to use both the orgianl<br />
        Rackspace OpenSwift V3 bindings as well as the new Openstack<br />
        V1 bindings.<br />
        <br />

        When uploading a file it's temporarily stored in the temp directory so<br />
        be sure to have appropriate permissions in place or add impersonation to your<br />
		web.config so the file system can upload the file.<br />
        <br />
		<br />
        I hope my example helps!
